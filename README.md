Learning to get more familiar with Github
Hey, this is Rajea. I'm just starting a career in software engineering . Part of the curriculam is to develop a solid understanding of how Git and Github work. So far, I've created a repository, created a branch off the main and right now I'm editing the README file for this branch :)

I successfully made a change to the branch, made a pull request, reviewed the request and finally merged changes to the main branch. Next step was to delete the branch but I thought I'll repeat this process once more without instructions to get more practice. Here we go, round two...
